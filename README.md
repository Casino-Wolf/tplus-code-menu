# Wisconsin-pplus-codemenu

Fork of Fracture's code menu as used in Project+ 2.2. Special thanks to Eon and DesiacX whose modding contributions contributed greatly to this!

# Changes:
* Various options re-arranged or re-worded for organization, brevity, and user-friendliness
* Unselected options are now an off-white color, with the currently-selected line remaining yellow regardless of value change
* Custom stagelist toggle includes Wisco and PMBR stagelist options
* Gameplay Modifiers and Flight Mode are re-grouped and re-sorted into their own sub-menus, with properly capped values
* Start-alts replace Y-alts in random Alternate Stages
* Universal Walljumping - brand-new toggle which enables walljumps for all characters
* Big Head Mode and Random Angle Mode toggles incorporated
* Includes Eon's fixes from P+ 2.26 onward for debug overlay flickers

Credits and thanks to the legends that made this fork possible at all:  
\* Fracture for the base code menu architecture as it appeared in Legacy TE and P+, as well as all the base tech that come with it.  
\* DesiacX for the helpful guides and implementations of adding external toggle codes, especially the Stagelist toggle configuration.  
\* Eon for providing the 2.27 debug overlay fix code, character walljump write address and parameters, and base codes for Big Head and Random Angle modes.  
\* DukeItOut for designing the GCTRM format which streamlines the gecko coding process start-to-finish, along with the flexible STEX file system which makes the Stagelist toggle possible.
