# Wisconsin-pplus-codemenu

Fork of Fracture's code menu as used in Project+ 2.2.

# Changes:
* Various options re-arranged for organization and user-friendliness
* Unchanged lines are now a slight grey color, with the currently-selected line remaining yellow regardless of value change
* Gameplay Modifiers and Flight Mode are re-sorted into their own sub-menus with properly capped values
* Start-alts replace Y-alts in random Alternate Stages
* Includes Eon's fixes from P+ 2.27 onward for debug overlay flickers, and other stability fixes

Added options:
* Stagelist (by Desi, with custom 5-stagelist implementation)
* Universal Walljumping (original, credit to Eon for the address + parameters)
* Balloon Hit Behavior (original, credit to Eon for the base code)
* Big Head Mode (by Eon, format by Desi)
* Random Angle Mode (by Eon, format by Desi)
* Crouch Knockback Multiplier (address thanks to Magus)
* Shield Decay and Regen Rate (addresses thanks to Snoe)

#### Credits and thanks to the legends that made this fork possible at all:  
\* **Fracture** for the base code menu architecture as it appears in Legacy TE and Project+, as well as all the great tech that comes with it.  
\* **DesiacX** for the helpful guides and implementations of adding external toggle codes, especially the Stagelist toggle configuration.  
\* **Eon** for providing the 2.27 debug overlay fix code, and for creating various codes used here.  
\* **DukeItOut** for designing the GCTRM format which streamlines the gecko coding process start-to-finish, along with the flexible STEX file system which makes the Stagelist toggle possible.
